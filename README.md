# AOC Difficulty Assessor

Assess the difficulty of Advent of Code puzzles as they get solved by the first contendors.

This first version compares the time it took for the 100th contendor to get 2 stars to historical data.

If the time for the 100th contendor is not yet available, the time of the last known contendor is used.

If there are no 2 stars yet, the times for the 1 stars are used.
